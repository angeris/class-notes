  abstract = {We introduce log-log convex programs, which are optimization problems with positive variables that become convex when the variables, objective functions, and constraint functions are replaced with their logs, which we refer to as a log-log transformation. This class of problems generalizes traditional geometric programming and generalized geometric programming, and it includes interesting problems involving nonnegative matrices. We give examples of log-log convex functions, some well-known and some less so, and we develop an analog of disciplined convex programming, which we call disciplined geometric programming. Disciplined geometric programming is a subclass of log-log convex programming generated by a composition rule and a set of functions with known curvature under the log-log transformation. Finally, we describe an implementation of disciplined geometric programming as a reduction in CVXPY 1.0.},

  abstract = {Physical design problems, such as photonic inverse design, are typically solved using local optimization methods. These methods often produce what appear to be good or very good designs when compared to classical design methods, but it is not known how far from optimal such designs really are. We address this issue by developing methods for computing a bound on the true optimal value of a physical design problem; physical designs with objective smaller than our bound are impossible to achieve. Our bound is based on Lagrange duality and exploits the special mathematical structure of these physical design problems. For a multi-mode 2D Helmholtz resonator, numerical examples show that the bounds we compute are often close to the objective values obtained using local optimization methods, which reveals that the designs are not only good, but in fact nearly optimal. Our computational bounding method also produces, as a by-product, a reasonable starting point for local optimization methods.},

  abstract = {Blockchains, and specifically smart contracts, have promised to create fair and transparent trading ecosystems. Unfortunately, we show that this promise has not been met. We document and quantify the widespread and rising deployment of arbitrage bots in blockchain systems, specifically in decentralized exchanges (or "DEXes"). Like high-frequency traders on Wall Street, these bots exploit inefficiencies in DEXes, paying high transaction fees and optimizing network latency to frontrun, i.e., anticipate and exploit, ordinary users' DEX trades. We study the breadth of DEX arbitrage bots in a subset of transactions that yield quantifiable revenue to these bots. We also study bots' profit-making strategies, with a focus on blockchain-specific elements. We observe bots engage in what we call priority gas auctions (PGAs), competitively bidding up transaction fees in order to obtain priority ordering, i.e., early block position and execution, for their transactions. PGAs present an interesting and complex new continuous-time, partial-information, game-theoretic model that we formalize and study. We release an interactive web portal, http://frontrun.me/, to provide the community with real-time data on PGAs. We additionally show that high fees paid for priority transaction ordering poses a systemic risk to consensus-layer security. We explain that such fees are just one form of a general phenomenon in DEXes and beyond---what we call miner extractable value (MEV)---that poses concrete, measurable, consensus-layer security risks. We show empirically that MEV poses a realistic threat to Ethereum today. Our work highlights the large, complex risks created by transaction-ordering dependencies in smart contracts and the ways in which traditional forms of financial-market exploitation are adapting to and penetrating blockchain economies.},

  title = {Design of {{Thermal Systems Using Topology Optimization}}},
  author = {Haertel, Jan Hendrik Klaas},
  year = {2018},
  abstract = {The goal of this thesis is to apply topology optimization to the design of different thermal systems such as heat sinks and heat exchangers in order to improve the thermal performance of these systems compared to conventional designs. The design of thermal systems is a com- plex task that has traditionally relied on experience, intuition, and trial and error approaches. Topology optimization, in contrast, allows for a systematic optimization of such systems and the identification of unintuitive and unexpected geometries. Both numerical optimizations and, to a lesser extent, experimental validations of optimized designs are presented within this the- sis. The main contribution of the thesis is the development of several numerical optimization models that are applied to different design challenges within thermal engineering.
Topology optimization is applied in an industrial project to design the heat rejection system of a robotic downhole oil well intervention tool and an optimized prototype is built that can operate in environments of 200 {$\smwhtcircle$}C instead of 175 {$\smwhtcircle$}C, opening a new market for the company. A similar model is used in a different project to optimize the heat sink of a commercial tablet. The design of 3D printed dry-cooled power plant condensers using a simplified thermofluid topology optimization model is presented in another study. A benchmarking of the optimized geometries against a conventional heat exchanger design is conducted and the topology optimized designs show a superior performance. A thermofluid topology optimization heat sink model is applied to the design of forced convection air-cooled heat sinks. Two topology optimized designs are exemplarily benchmarked against a size optimized parallel fin heat sink and an up to 13\% lower thermal resistance is found to be realized by the topology optimization. The design of cross-flow heat exchangers using thermofluid topology optimization is presented in another work. This novel approach can explicitly solve the Navier Stokes equations and capture the heat transfer in both fluids at a low computational cost.
Lastly, the fabrication and experimental validation of different topology optimized heat transfer devices is summarized. The developed robotic downhole tool prototype is successfully tested in the laboratory under conditions similar to those in boreholes. Two optimized commer- cial tablet heat sinks are manufactured, mounted in the device, and experimentally compared to an unoptimized heat sink. Moreover, the fabrication and experimental benchmarking of 3D optimized natural convection heat sinks against conventional heat sink designs is presented. Investment casting using 3D stereolithography printed patterns is used to fabricate different heat sink designs and this technology is demonstrated to be promising for the fabrication of topology optimized metal parts.},

  abstract = {The field of structural optimization is still a relatively new field undergoing rapid changes in methods and focus. Until recently there was a severe imbalance between the enormous amount of literature on the subject, and the paucity of applications to practical design problems. This imbalance is being gradually redressed. There is still no shortage of new publications, but there are also exciting applications of the methods of structural optimizations in the automotive, aerospace, civil engineering, machine design and other engineering fields. As a result of the growing pace of applications, research into structural optimization methods is increasingly driven by real-life problems. t-.Jost engineers who design structures employ complex general-purpose software packages for structural analysis. Often they do not have any access to the source program, and even more frequently they have only scant knowledge of the details of the structural analysis algorithms used in this software packages. Therefore the major challenge faced by researchers in structural optimization is to develop methods that are suitable for use with such software packages. Another major challenge is the high computational cost associated with the analysis of many complex real-life problems. In many cases the engineer who has the task of designing a structure cannot afford to analyze it more than a handful of times.},

The method iteratively solves a series of linear optimization problems to minimize the fitting error. To reduce the fitting error in each iteration, an extra plane is added in the region where the largest error occurs. For verification, we apply the method to create transistor-level models in 90-nm complementary metal-oxidesemiconductor technology. Numerical results indicate that the proposed method can generate process-dependent transistor-level models with reasonable modeling accuracy.},
